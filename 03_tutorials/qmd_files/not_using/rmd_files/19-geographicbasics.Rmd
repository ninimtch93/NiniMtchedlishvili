# Geographic data basics

Up to now, we've been looking at patterns in data for what is more than this, or what's the middle look like. We've calculated metrics like per capita rates, or looked at how data changes over time.

Another way we can look at the data is geographically. Is there a spatial pattern to our data? Can we learn anything by using distance as a metric? What if we merge non-geographic data into geographic data?

The bad news is that there isn't a One Library To Rule Them All when it comes to geo queries in R. But there's one emerging, called Simple Features, that is very good.

Go to the console and install it with `install.packages("sf")`

To understand geographic queries, you have to get a few things in your head first:

1. Your query is using planar space. Usually that's some kind of projection of the world. If you're lucky, your data is projected, and the software will handle projection differences under the hood without you knowing anything about it.
2. Projections are cartographers making opinionated decisions about what the world should look like when you take a spheroid -- the earth isn't perfectly round -- and flatten it. Believe it or not, every state in the US has their own geographic projection. There's dozens upon dozens of them.
3. Geographic queries work in layers. In most geographic applications, you'll have multiple layers. You'll have a boundary file, and a river file, and a road file, and a flood file and combined together they make the map. But you have to think in layers.
4. See 1. With layers, they're all joined together by the planar space. So you don't need to join one to the other like we did earlier -- the space has done that. So you can query how many X are within the boundaries on layer Y. And it's the plane that holds them together.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/geolayers.jpg"))
```

## Importing and viewing data

Let's start with the absolute basics of geographic data: loading and viewing. Load libraries as usual.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(janitor)
```

First: an aside on geographic data. There are many formats for geographic data, but data type you'll see the most is called the shapefile. It comes from a company named ERSI, which created the most widely used GIS software in the world. For years, they were the only game in town, really, and the shapefile became ubiquitous, especially so in government and utilities.

So more often than not, you'll be dealing with a shapefile. But a shapefile isn't just a single file -- it's a collection of files that combined make up all the data that allow you to use it. There's a .shp file -- that's the main file that pulls it all together -- but it's important to note if your shapefiles has a .prj file, which indicates that the projection is specified.

The data we're going to be working with is a file from the Department of Homeland Security that is every hospital in the US and the number of beds they have. I'm writing this during the days of coronavirus, and suddenly the number of hospital beds is a top concern. So let's look at where hospital beds are and how many of them are there.

When you do, it should look something like this:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/geolayers2.png"))
```

Simlar to `readr`, the `sf` library has functions to read geographic data. In this case, we're going to use `st_read` to read in our hospitals data. And then glimpse it to look at the columns.

```{r}
hospitals <- st_read("data/Hospitals/Hospitals.shp")

glimpse(hospitals)
```

This looks like a normal dataframe, and mostly it is.  We have one row per hospital, and each column is some feature of that hospital: the name, the address, it's open/closed status and more.  What sets this data apart from other dataframes we've used is the last column, "geometry", which is of a new data type.  It's not a character or a number, it's a "POINT", which is composed of a longitude value and a latitude value.  When we plot these on a grid of latitude and longitude, it will place a point where those two numbers intersect.

Let's look at just Maryland hospitals. Good news -- `sf` plays very nicely with the tidyverse, so we can filter data the way we are accustomed.

```{r}
md_hospitals <- hospitals %>%
  filter(STATE == "MD")

md_hospitals
```

We have 72 hospitals, according to this data.

What kind of hospitals do we have?

```{r}
md_hospitals %>%
  group_by(TYPE) %>%
  summarise(
    count=n()
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(count))
```
Let's narrow our data to only look at the 50 "General Acute Care hospitals."

```{r}

md_hospitals <- hospitals %>%
  filter(STATE == "MD") %>%
  filter(TYPE == "GENERAL ACUTE CARE")

md_hospitals

```

That gives us 50 hospitals in Maryland. Where are they?

We can simply plot them on a longitude-latitude grid using ggplot.

```{r}
md_hospitals %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf() +
  theme_minimal()
```

Each point is a hospital. Each hospital has been plotted according to its degrees of longitude and latitude.

If you know anything about the state of Maryland, you can kinda pick out the shape of the state there. The point in the top left is in Western Maryland. The point at the extreme bottom right is on the Eastern Shore. But this map is not exactly ideal. It would help to have a state and county map layered underneath of it, to help make sense of the spatial nature of this data.

This is where layering becomes more clear. First, we want to go out and get another shapefile, this one showing Maryland county outlines.

Instead of loading it from our local machine, like we did above, we're going to use a package to directly download it from the U.S. Census.  The package is called `tigris` and it's developed by the same person who made `tidycensus`.

In the console, install tigris with the install packages function

Then load it:

```{r}
library(tigris)
```

Now, let's use the counties() function from tigris to pull down a shapefile of all U.S. counties.

```{r}

counties <- counties()

glimpse(counties)
```

This looks pretty similar to our hospital shapefile, in that it looked mostly like a normal dataframe with the exception of the new geometry column.

But instead of POINT, this geometry is of the datatype "MULTIPOLYGON".  Points are shape data represented by one pair of longitude or latitude coordinates. Polygons are made up of LOTS of pairs of longitude and latitude coordinates, connected by a boundary line into a complex shape.  

If you've ever filled in a "connect the dots" picture by drawing lines between points, in order to reveal a hidden shape, then you're familiar with the concept.

This county shapefile has all 3233 U.S. counties.  We only want the Maryland counties, so we're going to filter the data to only keep Maryland counties.  There is no STATE column, but there is a STATEFP column, with each number representing a state.  Maryland's FP number is 24.

```{r}
md_counties <- counties %>%
  filter(STATEFP == "24")

```

To see what this looks like, let's plot it out with ggplot. We can pretty clearly see the shapes of Maryland counties.

```{r}
md_counties %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf() +
  theme_minimal()
```

With this county map, we can layer our hospital data.

Something to note: The layers are rendered in the order they appear. So the first geom_sf is rendered first. The second geom_sf is rendered ON TOP OF the first one.

We're also going to change things up a bit to put the datasets we want to display INSIDE of the geom_sf() function, instead of starting with a dataframe.  We have two to plot now, so it's easier this way.

```{r}

ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data=md_counties) +
  geom_sf(data=md_hospitals) +
  theme_minimal()
```
What can we tell from this?

Well, hospitals are clustered around the state's most populous areas, the Baltimore to Washington corridor. There are fewer hospitals in rural Eastern and Western counties. And two counties have no hospital at all.

This is a pretty blunt visualization. Not all hospitals are equal. Some have more beds than the others, and bed space is a critical factor in how full hospitals get during COVID-19 surges.  

We can get a sense of where the largest hospitals are, by changing the color of the points according to the number of beds. We do this by setting the aesthetic -- or aes -- to use the BEDS column inside of the geom_sf function.  To make the differences easier to see, we're going to change the fill of the counties white, too, and use a special color palette, viridis magma. We're also going to make the points slightly bigger.


```{r}

ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data=md_counties, fill="white") +
  geom_sf(data=md_hospitals, aes(color=BEDS), size=2) +
  scale_colour_viridis_b(option="magma") +
  theme_minimal()

```

With these changes, what else can we make out here?  Well, not only are most hospitals clustered in the center of Maryland, the largest ones are too. Rural areas have fewer and typically smaller hospitals.
