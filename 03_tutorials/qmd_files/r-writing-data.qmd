<strong>Writing Style Notes</strong><br>&nbsp;

<strong>Don't Overwhelm.</strong><br>&nbsp;


Be careful when you use a number in a story. You don't want to overwhelm the reader. You want to use a number of emphasize a specific point, not to prove that you were able to produce a results of a calculation.

Strategies to help people comprehend your data:

* Use ratios instead of percents
* Ratios are better in counts of 10. 6 of 10, 4 of 10. It's easy to translate that from a percentage to a ratio. 
* Round your numbers. If the Census Bureau says there is 287,401 people in Lincoln, round to 287,000 people. That's still accurate.
* Control the decimals. AP Style recommends rounding to the two decimals. Unless you need that precision (usually you don't), just round to the whole number
* Ditch the decimals for something that can't be divided (i.e. people)

<strong>Writing on a Human Scale</strong><br>&nbsp;

<br>

Express Your Numbers on Human Scale, not Robot Scale

* Robot scale: .07% of kindergarteners had a medical exemption to vaccines. 
* Human scale: 7 out of 10,000 kindergarteners had a medical exemption

* Robot scale: The state spends $16.6 billion per year on health care. 
* Human scale: Annually, the state spends the equivalent of $3,000 per person on health care.

<strong>When exact numbers matter</strong><br>&nbsp;

During the Covid19 pandemic, we used specific numbers for case counts and deaths. No rounding. We wouldn't write "there are more than 70 cases in Lancaster County" on Monday. People wanted the exact number: "there were 75 cases in Lancaster County." 

Ditto with "almost 30 deaths." Give the specific number: 28 deaths.
  Do not round bodies. 


<strong>More Writing Style Tips</strong><br>&nbsp;

Don’t use the “respectively” construction. It confuses the readers and leads to data errors.<br><br>Example: "Other private trade schools also made the top 10 list, such as Philander Smith in Little Rock and Bryan University in Rogers, with increases of 81 percent and 74 percent respectively."<br><br>Revision: "Other private trade schools also made the top 10 list, such as Philander Smith in Little Rock with an 81% increase and Bryan University in Rogers, with a 74% increase."</pre>

<strong>Common Errors – Math</strong><br>Percent vs Percentage Point<br>At Lyon College, 67 percent of non-first-generation students paid back their loans within five years, while only 53 percent of first-generation students did the same, which results in a 14 percent&nbsp;<strong>POINT&nbsp;</strong>difference. The median debt for both types of students was the same though, at $12,000.<br>You mean “percentage point.” 14 percent of 67 is 9.4.<br><br> Check out Steve Doig's useful [Math Crib Sheet for Journalists](Documents/MathCrib_Doig.pdf) that has many useful examples of common newsroom math.</a></pre>

<br>

<strong>Don't Forget The Base</strong><br>Student writes: "As of September 12, there was an increase of 173 cases in people ages 18 to 24. The 25 to 34 age group had the highest new case number, with 188 cases."<br>
--Context is missing. An increase of 173 from what? <strong>Provide the base number.</strong>

<h3>Avoid Errors and Style Problems</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->


<strong>Common errors</strong>    
--Don't begin a sentence with a number. Spell out numbers at the beginning of a sentence or just rephrase the sentence altogether.   
--Be alert to confusing millions, billions and trillions. Double check.   

<br>

<strong>Common style problems</strong>   

--Context! "18% homelessness in a district" - compared to what? Provide a statewide average.   
--When using a ranking, abbreviate the "number," i.e.: "He was my No. 1 choice."  
--Order of numbers. I prefer to see the latest numbers first, THEN the older numbers.
New material, then context.   
--Parallel comparisons. When possible, compare your data to the same period, i.e. summer to summer, avoid seasonal bias.
