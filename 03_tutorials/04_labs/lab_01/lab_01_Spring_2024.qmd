**Task**

### Spreadsheet Exercise #1

Get the data into Google Sheets

-   Download the \[Baltimore census income data\](assets/data/baltcity_income_clean.csv)

or: Download the \[Baltimore census income data directly from GitHub\](https://github.com/wellsdata/data_journalism_class/raw/main/04_labs/lab_01/baltcity_income_clean.csv)

-   Open Google Sheets. File \| Import \| Upload \| Select the downloaded file "baltcity_income_clean.csv" . After it uploads, select the green "Import Data" button.

In this data set, each row represents a Census district, and each column represents a feature of that district: its location, the median household income in 2010, 2016, 2020, the neighborhood identifier and geographic coordinators.

Using the Baltimore City household median income data, answer these questions:

**Q**

-   #1: Sort to find the neighborhoods with the highest median income in 2020. Identify the top three and the median income.

    -   Create a new tab on the Sheet, call it answers. Copy Question #1 and write Answer #1 and paste the relevant data into this space. Make it clear so someone new to your work will understand what is happening.

-   #2: Sort to find the neighborhoods with the lowest median income in 2020. Identify the top three and the median income.

    -   On the Answers tab of the Sheet, copy Question #2 and write Answer #2. Paste the relevant data into this space. Make it clear so someone new to your work will understand what is happening.

-   #3: Create a new pct_change_2020 column, calculate the percentage change in median income from 2010 to 2020. Identify the top three neighborhoods with the biggest gains and the three with the least.

    -   On the Answers tab of the Sheet, copy Question #3 and write Answer #3. Paste the relevant formula and data into this space. Make it clear so someone new to your work will understand what is happening.

-   #4: Determine the median value for 2010 and 2020, and the percentage change of these two values.

    -   On the Answers tab of the Sheet, copy Question #4 and write Answer #4. Paste the relevant formula and data into this space. Make it clear so someone new to your work will understand what is happening.

-   #5: With the data you have gathered and analyzed, write a 150-200 word story pitch. Put this on a Google Doc.

When you are finished, open the share settings, allow the instructor access, copy the URL and paste it into the submisssion box in Elms, like this:
